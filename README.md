### Reflection
After the Adurino Tutorials, something become different in my world. Computer programming and Electrical appliances programming exists in everywhere, I used to learned Java when I studyed in my senior high school but unfortunely that stuff did't keep on to the present. Arduino is asking people to work together to learn some basic knowledge about the Electrical appliances programming and make couples of works in ourselvers lead to the video they upload on Youtube. I learned one when I took the on-site courses in my university (Central Saint Martins), for me that's really attractive which made me sink deeply inside it. When I was a child, I would like to dismantle the electricities in my room and try to assemble them back. I will do some research about the program in this README file.

## Arduino
### What is Arduino?
Arduino is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller kits for building digital devices. It’s hardware products are licensed under a CC-BY-SA license, while software is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the GNU General Public License (GPL), permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards are available commercially from the official website or through authorized distributors.
Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards ('shields') or breadboards (for prototyping) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs. The microcontrollers can be programmed using the C and C++ programming languages, using a standard API which is also known as the "Arduino language". In addition to using traditional compiler toolchains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) and a command line tool developed in Go.
The Arduino project began in 2005 as a tool for students at the Interaction Design Institute Ivrea, Italy, aiming to provide a low-cost and easy way for novices and professionals to create devices that interact with their environment using sensors and actuators. Common examples of such devices intended for beginner hobbyists include simple robots, thermostats and motion detectors.
The name Arduino comes from a bar in Ivrea, Italy, where some of the founders of the project used to meet. The bar was named after Arduin of Ivrea, who was the margrave of the March of Ivrea and King of Italy from 1002 to 1014.

### What does Arduino mean to me?
For me, after learned the project about Arduino in on-site class and experienced the steps with the Youtube video in Arduino courses, I found it's something dislike the Java or Python programming which is about the computing, Arduino is a techique we can actually use in our daily life and try to fix the electrical stuff around us.

There is a button in that machine and when I press it, the light will shine, whether when I release it the light will blackout. I used 3 wires to connect the mainboard with the terminal board and there is another iron string to transfer the electric. After put the mainboard access to the power supply, I can control this little machine. 

## Java
### What is Java？
Java is one of the Greater Sunda Islands in Indonesia. It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south and the Java Sea to the north. With a population of 151.8 million, including the inhabitants of its surrounding islands, principally Madura, Java constitutes 56.1 percent of the Indonesian population. 147.7 million people live on Java itself, making it the world's most populous island. Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, is on Java's northwestern coast. Much of the well-known part of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man Site. Formed by volcanic eruptions due to geologic subduction of the Australian Plate under the Sunda Plate, Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass at about 138,800 square kilometres (53,600 sq mi). A chain of volcanic mountains is the east–west spine of the island. Four main languages are spoken on the island: Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, and Betawi, where Javanese and Sundanese are the most spoken. Only two ethnic groups are native to the island—the Javanese in the central and eastern parts and Sundanese in the western parts. The Madurese in the Eastern salient of Java are migrants from Madura Island, while the Betawi in the capital city of Jakarta are hybrids from various ethnic groups in Indonesia. Most residents are bilingual, speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) as their first or second language. While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java's population comprises people of diverse religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures. Java is divided into four administrative provinces: Banten, West Java, Central Java, and East Java, and two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.

### What did I learn about Java？
When I studied in my senior high school, my teacher taught me something about Java, and I even made a game with it, called Thunder fighter. Even that was the most simple one, this game could be my first experience from my childhood, I think that is quite memorable. 

# No amount of money ever bought a second of time.
(Source from the saying said by Iron Man in ‘Avengers ： End Game’）
Times flying, how can we expect doing something about the electricities when I was a kid. When I first heard this saying in 'Avengers : End Game', I found that is quite familiar which my mom and dad always talk to me around this idea. It's about time and actually what I needed to hear as I studying in England as a international student.
